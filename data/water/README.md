# hM3Dq with CNO water bottles

Paul injected Vglut2-Flpo;Lepr-Cre mice with AAV-Flp+Cre-hM3Dq virus. He kept them on normal water for 2 days, then on day 3 switched to CNO water for 3 days, then back to normal water for 2 days. He measured body weight, food weight, and water weight daily.

He asked me to run stats comparing the different groups.
